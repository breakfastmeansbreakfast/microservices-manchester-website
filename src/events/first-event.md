Hi everyone,

We are back with our 2nd event of the year. This time we have a security focused night with talks from Sam Newman and Anthony Fielding.

Thanks to our sponsors Thoughtworks, Moneysupermarket and MRJ Recruitment for their support in organising the meetup.

Event will start at 7pm, Federation House. We'll enjoy some pizza and drinks before talks start, so there will be time to mingle with other attendees.

Talks:
1 - Sam Newman, author of Building Microservices, will be giving a talk on security titled "Insecure Transit - Microservice Security"

2 - Agile Security - Anthony Fielding
Anthony Fielding was a senior software engineer with over 10 years in the industry before he decided to move into information security. Now as a security consultant he spends much of his time breaking applications for a living.

In this talk Anthony discusses how security tends to be an afterthought, as a round of testing only occurring at the end of sprints. He offers a more agile and proactive approach to building in security earlier.
